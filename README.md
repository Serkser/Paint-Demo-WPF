==========

A tutoring exercise in WPF for exploring general concepts in C# and XAML. 
This is a self tutoring project and will have constant rough edges as my main skills were in VB and F#. 
WPF is fairly involved to so a drawing type application gives a lot of scope for playing with a wide variety of techniques.

Where 3rd party code has directly helped me substantially, I note credit :)

My current plan is to expand the project to allow practice of various patterns.
There's no plan to build this into a production quality project and it's likely to get altered arbitarily.
